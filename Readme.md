In this challenge, I had to do two parts, one for analyzing and Exploring the Climate Data by using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database, specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The second part is for Designing my Climate App. I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed using Flask.

For Analyzing and Exploring Climate Data, I created the engine, session, and also automap_base(), which was used to reflect my table in classes. I managed to do different required queries and plots by using Dataframes and summary statistics _ please find more details in the comments in attached the climate_starter file.

To design my Climate App, I used the Flask application where I generated the engine to connect SQLite, I also created different API static routes _ please find more details in the comments in the main file.
